Hi, I'm Kalyan Bandaru, a data scientist with a keen interest in cybersecurity. With a background in computer science, I have worked as an Engineering Intern at BeyondSquareSolution pvt ltd and FireEye, where I have gained valuable experience in the field of cybersecurity. During my time at these companies, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects, including academic ones focused on networking and computer security. I was also the lead member on one of the projects I completed.

In addition to my work experience, I am familiar with programming languages such as C and Python, as well as web development tools such as HTML and CSS. I am always looking to expand my skillset and have actively participated in Pen Testing Workshops to improve my knowledge in this area.
