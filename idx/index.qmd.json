With a background in computer science, I have worked as an Engineering Intern at BeyondSquareSolution pvt ltd and FireEye, where I have gained valuable experience in the field of cybersecurity. During my time at these companies, I had the opportunity to work on some exciting projects, including academic ones focused on networking and computer security. I was also the lead member on one of the projects I completed.\n\nIn addition to my work experience, I am familiar with programming languages such as C and Python, as well as web development tools such as HTML and CSS. I am always looking to expand my skillset and have actively participated in Pen Testing Workshops to improve my knowledge in this area.\n\nAs a team player, I work well in groups and am always willing to lend a helping hand to my colleagues. I am also capable of working independently and have a great sense of initiative when it comes to solving problems. Furthermore, I have excellent communication skills, which allow me to effectively convey ideas and work collaboratively with others.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.335","theme":"cosmo","title":"Bandaru","image":"profile.jpg","about":{"template":"jolla","image-width":"20em","image-shape":"round","links":[{"icon":"linkedin","text":"LinkedIn","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyan-bandaru-0038071ba"},{"icon":"github","text":"Github","href":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kalyan-bandaru-0038071ba"},{"icon":"envelope","text":"Contact me","href":"mailto:kalyanpatrudubandaru@my.unt.edu"}]}},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
